## Overview

You'll find that the evolution logic is the same as the my [game of life clojure project](https://github.com/alexfaber2011/rally-exercises/commits?author=alexfaber2011)

I wasn't proud with the way the clojure project felt (boring command line input), so decided to spice it up with a fun website instead.
